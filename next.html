            About :
            <p>My name is Harshit and currently I am pursuing my B.tech degree in computer science from rajasthan
                technical university along with some freelancing work. My main focus is to learn as much new
                technologies as
                the ever evolving tech world fascinates me and inspires me to keep learning and changing.
            </p>
            <p> I'm a focused individual and I do my work with great enthusiasm and competence. Along with thay I am
                great
                at making others feel comfortable which makes working as a team enjoyable and very effective. I have
                been a
                part of various communities such as GDSC, FOSS Tech, linux etc. and I have organised events at various
                levels.</p>
